This is a project meant for demonstrating basic react structures and keeping course notes (https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux), intentionally kept as short as possible.
The two main components are App (smart component) and Person (dumb component).
Various notes are kept in TheoreticalBasis component.
